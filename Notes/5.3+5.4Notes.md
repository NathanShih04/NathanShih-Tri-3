## Notes 5.3, 5.4, and actions
### 5.3 

- There is a lot of bias within computing, mainly within explicit and implicit data. Explicit data would be a streaming site, (my own example being Amazon Prime), with your name and information, while implicit data could be what movies/shows you see. 

- Prime Video itself can also be biased, as it can redirect you to certain shows that you want to actually see, rather than boring movies, according to your recent searches. This can be something like Youtube Kids. 


### 5.4

- Crowdsourcing is basically using a large population to market a certain idea or product. These things could be used in collaboration with others as well, examples being spotify. GoFundMe is also an example of crowd sourcing as it is a way to get money by collaborating with others.
