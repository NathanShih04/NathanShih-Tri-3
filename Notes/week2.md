## Week 2 Notes 5.5, 5.6, and actions
### 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns

- In terms of legal and ethical concerns, there can be copyrights and protection of intellectual property.

- To go deeper into copyrights (legal copyrighting):
   - Creative Commons
   - Open source 
   - Open Access
 
5.5 Actions: 

- For personal, I chose the unlicense license because it is the most 'free', in the sense that it allows the most freedom for other people to use on their own in hopes of better understanding.

- For the Team project, we chose the MIT license. I believe some of us have used this license beforehand and we like to assume it is the default. It also provides a lot of leniency and freedom including usage and distribution without credit. However, it does state that the original holders would be liable for any problems that come from copying it.
 
### 5.6 Legal and Ethical Concerns

- Safe computing techniques would be understanding how to only distribute information that is not personal to you and is not needed by the program. This can be your social security number, which if given, can result in identity theft.

- Things like Keyloggers, Phising, and Rogue Access Points can also be detrimental to the user.
  
- Keylogger logs your keystrokes on your keyboard which is usually used to get a password.
  
- Phishing: usually sent in emails, click on a link, and you're likely going to lose access of your computer.

5.6 Actions: 

- PII that I have seen on projects in CompSci Principles include data about our name, date of birth, phone number, and emails. These are all able to be matched to a person and be identified based on it.
  
- I think that PII can be helpful in many ways but if too much information is given out to the wrong people, dangerous and malicious things can occur.

- Good passwords have a large variety of letters, numbers, and special characters. The password also must not follow any pattern and 2 factor authentication can be used for greater security.

- Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption
  - Syymmetric: One key is used to both encrypt and decrypt between both sides
  - Asymmetric: Both a public and private key is utilized for everyone to ensure greater security.
 
- In deployment, we used the certbot which allowed us to secure and go from http to https by getting an SSL certificate.

- A phishing scheme that I have learned the hardway was the fake discord message that tells you that you can get a premium subscription for free. I entered my email but I immediately realized it and set up 2 factor authentication.
- There is also the phishing technique that sends you fake emails that give you incentives in exchange for personal information.
