* Dopamine issues are present and things like YouTube and social media impact my personal study and success in highschool by distracting me and taking away time for productive work. There are also things like Discord which allow me to talk to friends and distract me from getting homework done. I get dopamine out of these things and always want to do them even if it hurts my school performance.

5.2 Digital Divide
* Based on socioeconomic and geographic demographics
* In some countries
  * Computers are not common in rural areas
  * Only small number of websites
  * Internet used to protect government
  * High level of surveillance to protect government

5.2 Actions:
* Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by providing help on forums or even creating websites for people that aren't familiar with technology.
* Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by making a website for a club that isn't familiar with technology. Make a Del Norte website for a Del Norte club.
* Red tape blocking is not empowerment as it hinders one's ability to utilize technology to the fullest. There is red tape blocking at Del Norte in the form of their blocker where some websites cannot be accessed without a vpn. In order to run a deployed website, one has to use a vpn.

## Create Task Project
### Ideas
* GPA Calc for student athletes
* Sports game
* Sports Quiz
### Final Decision
The idea we decided on in the end was a sports logo quiz. With the GPA calculator, we weren't able to get a couple requirements. And we weren't sure what sports game to create without it being wildly complicated. Which left us with our quiz. In our quiz, a sports team will be written at the top and you have to try and guess which logo is that team's out of 4 options. It will keep tally of your score and give you a final score at the end.

| Algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration  | Also included in question order randomizer. |
| Calls to student developed procedure | Calls question shuffler for random question order. |
| User Input  | Logo/answers for each question. |
| Instructions for output  | Final score at the end of the quiz. |
