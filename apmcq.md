The answer should have been D since it is possible that there is a problem that has an algorithmic solution but no solution that can solve all instances of the problem. The data storage doesn't matter as much since not all problems can be solved with an algorithm.

The answer should have been C since the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. There for it should be 25*5 + (numUnits - 25) * 7).

The answer should have been D since unauthorized individuals can use data mining and other techniques to guess a user's password. Overwhelming the system with login attempts would not result in unauthorized access.

The answer should have been D since the internet is a network of interconnected networks and the World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via the internet. I got this wrongs since I forgot what the World Wide Web was.

The answer should have been B II only since an overflow error will occur on values over 15. On II, it will result in 17 meaning it would result in an overflow error. It can't be III since 12+3 is 15 and that won't result in an overflow error.

The answer should have been C (7) since 7 bits will allow for 128 sequences based on 2^7 = 128. I got this wrongs since I forgot how to calculate sequences based on bits.

The answer should have been C since the question asks for the following groups LEAST likely to receive targeted advertisements. It would be individuals who sign up for a premium account since they do not receive advertisements at all.
